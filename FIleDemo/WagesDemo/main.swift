            Then addHandlersForProgres method will save progressBlock and completedBlock into NSMutableDictionary <NSString *, id> SDCallbacksDictionary and then return and save it into downloadOperationCancelToken.

            In addition, operation in addHandlersForProgress method does not clear the previous stored callbacks. They are saved incrementally, which means that all the callBacks will be executed in sequence after download completion.

            If the operation is nil„ÄÅisFinished or isCancelled will call createDownloaderOperationWithUrl:options:context: to create a new operation and store it in URLOperations and configure completionBlock. So that URLOperations can be cleared when the task is completed. Then call addHandlersForProgress:completed: to save progressBlock and completedBlock. At last submit operation to the downloadQueue.
